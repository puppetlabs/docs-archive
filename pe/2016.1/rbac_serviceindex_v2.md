The role-based access control (RBAC) service enables you to manage users, directory groups, and roles.

> **Note:** In addition to the endpoints on this page and in the [v1 RBAC service API](./rbac_serviceindex_v1.html), there are some endpoints that you can use to check the health of the RBAC service. These are available through the [status API documentation](./status_api.html#the-status-api).

The v2 API service consists of the endpoints below.

## Revoke token
A user's access to PE services can be controlled using authentication tokens. Users can revoke authentication tokens using the [`tokens` endpoint](./rbac_revoke_token_v2.html).
