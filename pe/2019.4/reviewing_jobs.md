# Reviewing jobs

You can review jobs—on-demand Puppet run, task, plan, or scheduled—from the console or the command line.

-   **[Review jobs from the console](reviewing_jobs_in_the_console.md#)**  
View a list of recent jobs and drill down to see useful details about each one.
-   **[Review jobs from the command line](reviewing_jobs_on_the_cli.md#)**  
Use the `puppet job show` command to view running or completed jobs.
