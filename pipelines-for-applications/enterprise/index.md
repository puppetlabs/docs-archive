## An overview of CI/CD with Pipelines for Applications

**Continuous integration** (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository on a regular basis. Each check-in is verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.

**Continuous deployment** (CD) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce valuable software in short cycles and ensure that the software can be reliably built, tested, and deployed. The build, test, and deploy processes are automated.

Pipelines for Applications was created to enable powerful, customizable CI/CD for teams of all sizes. By attaching a Pipelines application to your software repository, you enable auto builds. When a developer on your team checks in new or updated code, Pipelines for Applications grabs a copy of the code and auto-builds it. Successful builds trigger automated deploys, and Pipelines for Applications pushes changes to your servers.
