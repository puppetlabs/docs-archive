Use Helm charts in Pipelines for Containers to manage the complexity of Kubernetes. A Helm chart collects your Kubernetes resources and dependencies into a package that you can use to deploy and operate your application stack, and keep track of new releases.

With Pipelines for Containers, you can deploy a sanctioned Helm chart from a public repo, or create and deploy your own custom charts. After youâ€™ve deployed a custom chart, you can the chart to a pipeline to automate it.
