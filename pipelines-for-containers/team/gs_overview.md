Welcome to Getting started with Pipelines for Containers. This guide shows you how to deploy a WordPress blog to a Kubernetes cluster and automate the blog in a pipeline.

At the heart of Pipelines for Containers lies a simple workflow: add, build, deploy, and automate. In this guide, you add your containers, build them, deploy them to a cluster, and finally automate them in a pipeline.

You can complete this guide without prior knowledge of Kubernetes and containers. However, understanding the fundamental concepts behind Kubernetes and containers is important if you want to get the most out of Pipelines. For more information, take a look at the following official documentation from Docker and Kubernetes:
