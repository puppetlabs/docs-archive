Use a project to gather everything you need to build, deploy and automate your containers. 

Before you create a project, make sure you've set up [Integrations](./integrate.md) for your source and container repositories.

After you've created a project, you can:
* [Add and build containers](./container.md). 
* [Deploy containers to a Kubernetes cluster](./deployment-set-up.md).
* [Automate your builds and deployments in a pipeline](./pipeline-set-up.md).
* [Build and deploy Helm charts](./helm-overview.md).
* [Create services to expose container ports](./pfc_services.md). 
* <a href="./cluster-namespace.html#create-namespace-secrets">Create and manage secrets</a>. 
* [Set up email and Slack notifications for builds and deployments](./notification.md).
